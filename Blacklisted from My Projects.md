A few users and communities have been blacklisted from my projects. This document lists who and why.

|1| **beatrun.ru community**|Extremely hostile interactions with two of their most prominent members, `JonnyBro` and `relaxtakenotes` (the latter was extremely hostile from the start) related to Beatrun licensing.|13:30 GMT+7 20/12/2024|"Jonny"'s Steam account ID is blacklisted in my current projects. Past projects (before 20/12/2024) are not affected[^1]. I would block `relaxtakenotes` as well but I can't get their Steam ID.
