...hi?

I'm someone with, well, a little knowledge of Garry's Mod Lua and interested in C++ and C#. Working on a parkour gamemode for said game inspired by Titanfall and the Mirror's Edge games, which is currently in conceptual/PoC state.

I dislike web technologies for local apps- like, don't libraries or stuff like Qt exists?

I can be reached at `lamhung12700@gmail.com` or as `LostTrackpads` on Discord.
