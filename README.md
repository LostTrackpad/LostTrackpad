Taking a break from Garry's Mod scripting until January 1, 2025.

**If anyone would like to negotiate regarding that one Garry's Mod parkour gamemode, send me an email. It's below in this README. Not accepting anything else.**

...hi?

I'm someone with, well, a little knowledge of Garry's Mod Lua and interested in doing C++ and C# stuff eventually. Working on a parkour gamemode for said game inspired by Titanfall and the Mirror's Edge games, which is currently in conceptual/PoC state.

I'm interested in getting better controller support in general on PC platforms, and I dislike web technologies for local apps (stuff that runs directly on your hardware)- like, don't libraries or stuff like Qt exists?

Used to be associated with a Beatrun community, however I have detached myself completely due to some code licensing related things.

I can be reached at `lamhung12700@gmail.com` or as `LostTrackpads` on Discord.

**I can't separate humorous communication from non-humor communication, especially online. You might want to tone down your humor when talking to me.**

Fun fact: You can see this README's history [here!](https://github.com/LostTrackpad/LostTrackpad/commits/main/)
