...hi?

I'm someone with, well, a little knowledge of Garry's Mod Lua and interested in C++ and C#. Working on a parkour gamemode for said game inspired by Titanfall and the Mirror's Edge games, which is currently in conceptual/PoC state.

I'm interested in getting controller support in general on PC platforms, and I dislike web technologies for local apps (stuff that runs directly on your hardware)- like, don't libraries or stuff like Qt exists?

Used to be associated with a Beatrun community, however I have detached myself completely due to some code licensing related things.

I can be reached at `lamhung12700@gmail.com` or as `LostTrackpads` on Discord.
